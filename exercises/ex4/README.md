## Exercise 4 - Configure Business Actions in Events-to-Business-Actions Framework

In this exercise, you will define business action in the action-management extension application of Events-to-Business-Actions framework running on SAP BTP. Ensure your application's **Requested State** is **Started**.

### 1. Create Destinations

For the scope of this Hands-On , we have already set-up the destinations needed.
